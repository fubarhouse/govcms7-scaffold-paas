description: |
  Ensure there are no hard coded references to the default theme path in the
  deployed theme as this can and will cause a lot of HTTP 404s.
remediation: |
  Use a preprocess hook, and inject the path to the asset, using a function
  such as `drupal_get_path()`.
success: No default theme paths found.
failure: |
  References ({{results.found}}) to the default theme path were found:
  Filepath | Line | Code
  -------- | ---- | ----
  {{#results.findings}}
  {{basename}} | {{line}} | `{{code}}`
  {{/results.findings}}
parameters:
  directory:
    default: '%root/%themes/'
  whitelist:
    default:
      - \.md
      - \.txt
      - \.svg
      - \.png
  patterns:
    default:
      - sites\/g\/files\/net
